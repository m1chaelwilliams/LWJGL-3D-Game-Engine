Day 1

This is everything I accomplished after the first day of
development. Keep in mind that this is my first engine and
a lot of it is temporary spaghetti. I also went ahead and
left in my engine tester aswell as test assets to make it
easier to try it out.

- Window
- Render pipeline
- object loader
- Lighting and textures
- First person Camera
- Utilities (Keyboard class, Mouse class, Time class)
- Some organization (attempts)
- GameObject class

Overall I spent about 5 hours on the project today.
I definately won't keep up this pace in the future but
we'll see how far this project makes it!
